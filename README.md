# pygrunt #

pygrunt is a simple build system for C/C++ projects.

Projects are described entirely in Python. Since Python is also an excellent scripting language
with a huge ecosystem built around it, it makes easy to do secondary tasks like checking platform,
conditionally including or excluding source files, filter them based on certain conditions,
move files around on the filesystem or handle command-line parameters.

Since the project is a one-night experiment so far ( *a too long night...* ), it supports only
MinGW ( currently called GCCCompiler, to be fixed in the future ) on Windows ( sloppy
slash-handling ). However, pygrunt is designed compiler-independence in mind. It should
be relatively easy to add support for other compilers, given enough knowledge about the compiler
itself.

Features are also in short supply, we'll see where this project goes.

## Usage ##

Write a Python script that uses the pygrunt module and let it do the work. Currently, if all
you need is to compile a bunch of source files and link them together, pygrunt should be fine.
See the repo's root directory for examples; here's both of them anyhow:

A simple project with a few C files:

```python
import pygrunt

def main():
    project = pygrunt.Project('vecmath')
    project.working_dir = 'compile-src/'
    project.output_dir = 'build/'

    project.define('DEBUG')
    project.flag('Wall')
    project.add_sources('vecmath/*.c')

    cc = pygrunt.GCCCompiler()
    cc.optimize('size')
    cc.compile_project(project)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```

Output:
```
Looking for GCC on PATH...
Found GCC at D:\dev\compilers\mingw\bin\gcc.exe
Compiling compile-src/vecmath\main.c -> build/vecmath\main.o... success
Compiling compile-src/vecmath\vector.c -> build/vecmath\vector.o... success
Linking executable build/vecmath ...
```

[GLwrap](https://github.com/elementbound/glwrap) compiled with pygrunt instead of CMake:

```python
import pygrunt

def main():
    project = pygrunt.Project('glwrap')
    project.working_dir = 'compile-src/glwrap/'
    project.output_dir = 'build/'
    project.type = 'library'
    project.sanitize()

    project.add_sources('*.cpp')
    project.add_sources('mesh/*.cpp')

    # The order of linked libraries is preserved
    # The same does not apply to source files
    project.link('glfw3')
    project.link('gdi32')
    project.link('opengl32')
    project.link('glew32')
    project.link('png')
    project.link('z')

    cc = pygrunt.GCCCompiler(cpp=True)
    cc.optimize('more')
    cc.standard('c++11')
    cc.compile_project(project)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

Output:
```

## Todo ##

* Decide what should go into the Compiler and what should go into the Project. The line between
    the two is a bit ambigious at the moment. The Project should contain all the necessary
    information, the Compiler should just turn those into instructions for the actual compiler
    process.
* Clean up directory separator handling ( occasionally that forward slash becomes a backslash
    and vice versa )
* More features, of course
* If I have enough time, add support for another compiler ( clang? ) just as a proof of concept
